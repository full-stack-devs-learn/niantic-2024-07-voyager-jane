Class: Rectangle

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
        getArea() should return zero if either the width or height is negative.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        getArea(), Line 42 (originally)

        What test helped you find the bug?
        getArea_shouldCalculateAreaCorrectly_whenCalled()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        I set up an if condition where if either height or width is less than or equal to zero, return 0.

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
        Class variable width and height are public and therefore can be changed by a different party without a setter function. Access to class variables should not be public.l

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        public int width, Line 5
        public int height, Line 6

        What test helped you find the bug?
        newDefaultRectangle_shouldBeFiveFive_whenCreated() -> i just tried to see if setting the public variables would change default and it did.

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        Set the class variables to private.

    Bug 3:

        Describe the bug/error:
        Perimeter calculating incorrectly - it was only adding the width and height together once.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        getPerimeter(), Line 52 (originally)

        What test helped you find the bug?
        getPerimeter_shouldCalculatePerimeterCorrectly_whenCalled()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        Set getPerimeter to return (2 * width) + (2 * height).
